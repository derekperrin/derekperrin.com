    "We'll be working a lot with algebraic sets known as _groups_. Formally, a group $G$ is a non-empty set along with a binary operation $\\cdot: G \\times G \\to G$ that satisfies the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity**: There exists a unique element $e$ in $G$ such that for any $g$ in $G,$ $e \\cdot g = g \\cdot e = g.$\n",
    "2. **Associativity**: Let $f, g, h$ be elements of $G.$ Then $f \\cdot (g \\cdot h) = (f \\cdot g) \\cdot h).$\n",
    "3. **Inverses**: For any $g$ in $G$, there exists a unique element $h$ such that $g \\cdot h = h \\cdot g = e.$ We denote this element $h = g^{-1}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Loosely speaking, a group is a set of objects which we can \"add\" together to get other objects in the group. There exists an element $e$ known as the identity, and it is the \"do-nothing\" element (i.e. if we \"add\" it to something else, nothing happens). We can obtain $e$ by \"subtracting\" any object from itself. \n",
